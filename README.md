## Hexo Basics
Some hexo command:
```bash
hexo new post "<post name>" # you can change post to another layout if you want
hexo clean && hexo generate # generate the static file
hexo server # run hexo in local environment
hexo deploy # hexo will push the static files automatically into the specific branch(gh-pages) of your repo!
```

# Have fun ^_^
